        <h2>Introduction to Integrated Development of Commercial Floriculture</h2>
        <p>Commercial floriculture involves cultivating flowers on a large scale for sale to markets. The objective of this project is to promote the integration of sustainable practices in floriculture to improve yield, prevent diseases, and ensure environmentally friendly pest management. By focusing on best practices, we aim to enhance the quality of flowers and ensure economic sustainability for floriculture farmers.</p>

        <h2>Common Flower Diseases and Their Management</h2>
        <p>Flower diseases are a major challenge in floriculture, impacting plant health and quality. Below are some common flower diseases, along with images to help identify them:</p>

        <div class="gallery">
            <div>
                <h3>Powdery Mildew</h3>
                <img src="images/powdery_mildew.jpg" alt="Powdery Mildew on Flowers">
                <p>Powdery mildew appears as white, powdery spots on leaves and flowers. It can weaken plants and reduce flower production.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Botrytis Blight</h3>
                <img src="images/botrytis_blight.jpg" alt="Botrytis Blight on Flowers">
                <p>Botrytis blight causes wilting and grey mold, typically in damp and humid conditions.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Downy Mildew</h3>
                <img src="images/downy_mildew.jpg" alt="Downy Mildew on Flowers">
                <p>Downy mildew results in yellow spots and moldy growth on leaves, particularly under humid conditions.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Fertilizers for Healthy Flower Growth</h2>
        <p>Fertilizers play a crucial role in providing essential nutrients for flowers. These can be organic or chemical, depending on the cultivation needs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Composted manure, fish emulsion, and organic compost are excellent for improving soil structure and providing nutrients.</li>
            <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> These are typically NPK-based (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) fertilizers, which provide essential macro-nutrients for growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Slow-Release Fertilizers:</strong> Slowly release nutrients over time to ensure consistent feeding and reduce the risk of over-fertilization.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="gallery">
            <div>
                <h3>Organic Fertilizer</h3>
                <img src="images/organic_fertilizer.jpg" alt="Organic Fertilizer">
                <p>Organic fertilizers, such as composted manure, enrich the soil and improve its health.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Chemical Fertilizer</h3>
                <img src="images/chemical_fertilizer.jpg" alt="Chemical Fertilizer">
                <p>Chemical fertilizers help meet the immediate nutritional needs of plants but should be used judiciously.</p>

        <h2>Pest Management in Floriculture</h2>
        <p>Pests can cause significant damage to flowers, affecting growth and quality. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an eco-friendly approach that combines cultural, biological, and chemical methods to control pests effectively. Common pests in floriculture include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> Small insects that damage flowers by sucking sap from leaves and stems.</li>
            <li><strong>Spider Mites:</strong> Tiny arachnids that cause stippling on leaves and webbing on flowers.</li>
            <li><strong>Thrips:</strong> Small insects that damage flowers by feeding on plant tissues, causing discoloration and scarring.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="gallery">
            <div>
                <h3>Aphids</h3>
                <img src="images/aphids.jpg" alt="Aphids on Flowers">
                <p>Aphids are small, green insects that feed on plant sap and transmit diseases.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Spider Mites</h3>
                <img src="images/spider_mites.jpg" alt="Spider Mites on Flowers">
                <p>Spider mites create webbing and cause yellowing or stippling on leaves.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Thrips</h3>
                <img src="images/thrips_damage.jpg" alt="Thrips Damage on Flowers">
                <p>Thrips feed on flower buds and petals, leaving them damaged and discolored.</p>
